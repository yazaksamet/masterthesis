Chatfield 2004;

(i) removing the trend and seasonality in order to achieve a stationary time series, 
(ii) fitting an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model to the stationary time series
(iii) predicting future values using the ARMA model.


(1) How should x(s, t) be dealt with after identifying it as a normal observation or as
an outlier?
(2) How can errors and events be distinguished?
(3) When and how should the time-series model be updated?

Median smoothing (Basu and Meckesheimer 2007)
was used to replace obvious errors and missing data within a smoothing window, prior to
undertaking the above analysis.
